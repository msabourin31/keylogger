To setup the "attack":
Load the two excutbales onto a USB drive. Then create a text file and name it Notes.txt. You will then create a shortcut to the copy executable and name it Notes.txt.
You then want to hide the tow executables and the .txt file. All that should be visible is the shortcut. You can change the icon of the shortcut to resemble a text file.
After this the setup is complete. If a "victim" picks up the USB stick and opens the shortcut, the copy execuatbale will run and copy the keylogger onto the "victims" machine.
It will then send you back the data when the file hits a certain size.
